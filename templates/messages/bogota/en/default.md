Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

I noticed that you have made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap-OSM in Bogot√°.
Congratulations and thank you!
From now on, you can consider yourself part of the OSM Colombia community.
Your edits are already in the database, but some may not yet be visible on the maps. You may have to wait a bit or refresh your browser.

You have started this journey into the world of OpenStreetMap, where you will discover many things.
You will see that it is exciting.

To start, here are some interesting links:

* I recommend reading the [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page).
There you will find all the information you need.
We, the map contributors, continuously read the Wiki; if something is not explained well, we document it there.

* In Colombia, we have a [Guide to mapping](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Colombia/Guide_for_mapping) that explains in detail what you can map and how you can do it.
I recommend you read it to be sure of what you are doing.

* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org/es/) is a good place to learn about the OSM world.
Instructions are provided for the iD editor (which can be used from a web browser) and for a more advanced editor, JOSM (a Java Application).

* If you can't find how to map something in your editor, the quickest solution is to look it up on the [map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) wiki page.
In that list, you can see everything that can be added to the map.
Although this list may seem huge initially, you will quickly be able to determine how to improve the map.
Remember that not everything that can be mapped is valid for Colombia, so I told you to check this guide first.

* If you have a web page and you want to incorporate the OpenStreetMap map, you can check this site: [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

* It's always good to know who is contributing to the map near your working area so that you can look at [resultmaps](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/). You will see that hundreds of people are working on this project there.

If you have doubts or questions like the following:

* do I think I have damaged something?
* how do I map something I can't find in the wiki?

Then, you can use one of these means to contact the community:

* the OpenStreetMap community in Colombia has a [Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/osmco) where you can ask questions or learn about their activities.
It is a space where members discuss things around the map.
You can start by greeting the community, introducing yourself, and sharing your interest in OSM.

* There is also [the communications platform Community (Discourse)](https://community.openstreetmap.org/), where you can ask anything and have a wider audience.

* In Bogota, we have the group [MaptimeBogota](https://maptime.io/bogota/) that organizes meetings periodically, to map the city.
It is an ideal event for beginners like you since we explain everything from the beginning.
Don't miss the [next event](https://www.meetup.com/maptime-bogota-colombia-osm/).
You can also contact us by [Telegram](https://t.me/MaptimeBogota).

* Conversely, if you need to add a business without knowing the mapping details, you can use the [MyBusiness](https://maptimebogota.github.io/minegocio/) tool.

Now, you may be wondering what I can map now.
I recommend that you add things that are close to you and that you know well, such as:
Constructions (houses, buildings); stores (restaurants, hairdressers); roads; sidewalks and pedestrian paths; chairs/benches.
Remember, you are the expert in your area!
If you find a business on the already mapped map, you can complement it by adding its address, opening hours, and social networks. 
You will see how much fun it is to fill the map around you with details.

You can also use applications like [Every Door](https://every-door.app/) or [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) to add details to the map from your cell phone.

Finally, reply to this message or join one of the local channels so the community can get to know you and we can work together.

Enjoy the mapping!
