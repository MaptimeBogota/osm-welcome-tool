Hi {{ mapper.displayName }}

We noticed you made your first contribution to OpenStreetMap-OSM.
Congratulations, and thanks!
You can now consider yourself part of the Colombian OSM community.
Your edit is live within a couple of minutes.
After that, you must refresh your browser to see your changes.

We want to be with you while discovering the world of OpenStreetMap.

To begin, we share with you some interesting links:

* We highly recommend using the [OSM wiki-pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
There you can get the information that you need.

* In Colombia, we have a [Guide to map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Colombia/Guide_for_mapping) that explains in detail what you can map and how to do it.

* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM.
Instructions are available for the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor (Java application).

* If you don’t find how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is to look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki.
You can see all you can add to the map in that list.
Initially, this list could be huge, but you can imagine how to improve the map by just looking.

* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

If you have any questions like:
I might have broken something, or you’re in doubt about how to map something particular, then you can use one of these channels to contact the community:

* The OpenStreetMap Colombian community has a [Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/osmco) where you can ask anything or to know their activities.
This is a space where members discuss different things about the map.

* For more complicated questions, search for them or post them on the [forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org).

We also use several social networks, so you can interact with the community and learn about upcoming events, milestones reached, or anything related to OSM in Colombia. These are the social networks we use for you to follow us and help us spread the word about the project:

* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/osm_colombia/).
* [X Twitter](https://twitter.com/OSM_Colombia).
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/osmcolombia).
* [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/osm_colombia).

So, what should you map next?
We highly recommend adding features around you, like:
Restaurants, businesses, streets, sidewalks, and benches are features you know best.
You are the expert.
If you find a business already mapped, ensure the address is also mapped.
There is something satisfying about filling in the map around you.
Or correcting a road when the local government makes changes to it.
Do you have any special interests, like biking, hiking, or trains?
Did you know we have the best bike, hiking, and train worldwide networks of any site?
But like everything else, they can always use improvements.

Happy Mapping!
