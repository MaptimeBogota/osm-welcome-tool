Hello {{mapper.displayName}},

Welcome to OpenStreetMap(OSM) and thank you for your contributions to the map!

As a new mapper on OSM you may have a lot of questions about what to map and how to map it. Here are some useful links to help you get started:

* OpenStreetMap's US Chapter runs a [Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/) server.  Slack is a collaboration tool for OSM mappers, organizers, and developers. This is a very active forum and the best way to get in touch with other local mappers in the United States.
* I highly recommend using the OSM [wiki-pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/). If you're not sure how to map something within the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is to look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) on the wiki. For more complicated questions you can ask/search on the [forum](https://community.openstreetmap.org/) or the #tagging channel on Slack. You can learn about the importance of a quality changeset comment [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments).
* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org) is a good place to learn more about OSM. Instructions are available for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.
* Want to see who’s mapping near you, or want to see how much you’ve been doing yourself, check out the maps at [resultmaps.neis-one.org](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/).
* If you are a business owner and want to learn how to add OpenStreetMap to your website, check out the site [Switch2OSM](https://switch2osm.org/)

If you’re wondering what to map next, we encourage you to look for things in your area that are missing or may need to be updated. Reaching out to your local community is also a great way to learn about projects in your area.

Remember to have fun and let us know if you have any questions!

Happy mapping!
